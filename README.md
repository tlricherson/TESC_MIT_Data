Course materials for Winter 2020 TESC MIT Data elective

## Syllabus ##
### Course description ###
Public narratives about schools often focus on measures of student performance. However the acts of teaching and learning are more complex than traditional data representations can describe. Although most models of data use begin with data, it is the use of questions and predictions that enable us to tell a compelling story. Join our conversation about how to repurpose and leverage data to create, inspire, and communicate with audiences about what matters most to you. As part of this interactive course, we will share examples of data stories from classroom, school, and district levels, as well as strategies for constructing new narratives about student and school outcomes. Participants will leave with tools to encourage an inquiry-based approach to data conversations. 

### General information ###
The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the ways teachers collect, represent, and use data as part of their professional practice. Topics will include ethical data practices, as well as inclusive ones. During each class, we will spend time critiquing data visualizations as a way to learn more about how to best communicate with data. You will also engage in some discussion around the background reading. We will use table top exercises with data to identify strategies for telling stories with data. 

Course materials, including session agendas and assignments will be placed on this repository. Use the links above for each session to find the resources.
