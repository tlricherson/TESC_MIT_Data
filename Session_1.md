In this session, we will consider how data use in schools has evolved, as well as an overview of the skills needed to use data effectively in the classroom. We will also start building an idea of what it means to tell a story with data.

## Readings ##
Please complete these prior to our first meeting.

We will use the skills list in the article below to organize our learning throughout the course. As you read, think about which skills you have and which ones you would like to build experience with.
