# Session Five: Evaluate outcomes #

We made it!!!

In our final session, we will look at the larger roles and responsibilities educators have in using data. Based on your input during our first session, iterative decision cycles (sometimes referred to as *continuous improvement*) will be a focus of our conversation.

### Power ###
Read [Miriam Posner](https://twitter.com/miriamkp)'s summary of her keynote on [The radical potential of the Digital Humanities: The most challenging computing problem is the interrogation of power](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/08/12/the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/) to think more about structures of power, like race and gender, as they relate to how we use data.

A pop-up shop in London will trade you your data for something you want to buy. Take a look [inside the store that only accepts personal data as currency](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/data-dollar-store-london-ben-eine/).

### Bias ###
All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity

It's always important to be aware of the biases we bring to our work. Use this infographic codex to view [all possible cognitive biases in one spot](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-single-cognitive-bias/).

### Equity ###
How do we develop more pluralistic data designs---ones which are inclusive of ideas from the full spectrum of genders, races, and cultures? What is the history of this work? Check out how [W.E.B. DuBois represented African-American life in 1900](http://publicdomainreview.org/collections/w-e-b-du-bois-hand-drawn-infographics-of-african-american-life-1900/), [Florence Nightingale](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/florence-nightingale-passionate-statistician), or the work of [Elizabeth Peabody](http://lklein.com/2014/12/visualization-as-argument/) shared by Lauren Klein.

We can use our stories to [recover unusual histories](https://vimeo.com/179040817). At the 2016 Eyeo conference, Sara Hendren talks about "design for Know-Nothings, Dilettantes, and Melancholy Interlopers – Translators, impresarios, believers, and the heartbroken—this is a talk about design outside of authorship and ownership, IP or copyright, and even outside of research and collaboration. When and where do ideas come to life? What counts as design?"

All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity.

[Lauren Klein](https://twitter.com/laurenfklein) has written about [visualization as argument](http://lklein.com/2014/12/visualization-as-argument/).

From 2009, a [paper-based visualization competition](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2009/02/paper-based_visualization_competition_the_winner_and_more.html). How can we make data more experiential?

### Ethics ###
[Lena Groeger](https://twitter.com/lenagroeger) of ProPublica reminds us that "The data doesn't speak for itself---it echoes its collectors." Watch her 2017 Tapestry presentation on [When the storyteller shows up in the story](https://youtu.be/TvJYDz8849g) to think more about how various biases show up in the visuals we produce.
