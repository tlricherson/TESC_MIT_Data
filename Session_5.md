### Power ###
* Read [Miriam Posner](https://twitter.com/miriamkp)'s summary of her keynote on [The radical potential of the Digital Humanities: The most challenging computing problem is the interrogation of power](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/08/12/the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/) to think more about structures of power, like race and gender, as they relate to how we use data.
* A pop-up shop in London will trade you your data for something you want to buy. Take a look [inside the store that only accepts personal data as currency](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/data-dollar-store-london-ben-eine/).

### Bias ###
* All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity
* It's always important to be aware of the biases we bring to our work. Use this infographic codex to view [all possible cognitive biases in one spot](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-single-cognitive-bias/).
