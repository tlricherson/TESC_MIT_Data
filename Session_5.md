In our final session, we will look at the larger roles and responsibilities educators have in using data. How do we involve other stakeholders in our work? Whether they are peers, students, families, or community, we can use data with them (as opposed to something we do to them) to enact and support positive change.

## Agenda ##

## Background ##
One of the promises of our abundance of data is its _democratization_—the ability for anyone to access and share the stories found within the data. However, this work requires a basic level of data literacy that many may not have. Miriam Posner, a professor in the digital humanities program at UCLA, reminds us that “The boxes we use to label others are often not the ones they might use to describe themselves.” When data use and storytelling with data are the province of only a few skilled people, we are not inclusive of the views of others. We can only expect disproportionate outcomes from this absence of voice “because a single visualization supplied by authorities may show only one facet of the data” (Jofre, 2016). To use data in service of equity, we must do better in our collaborations with students, parents, and the community. This is not just about building their skills with data, but also creating spaces for them to tell their own stories. In Feminism and Methodology: Social Science Issues (1987), Sandra Harding notes that “the questions an oppressed group wants answered are rarely requests for so-called truth. Instead, they are queries about how to change conditions.” 

## Projects and examples ##
* Check out a community-based example from Barcelona and consider the reasons wy [Smart Cities Need Thick Data, Not Big Data](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Smith15/publication/326849902_Smart_cities_need_thick_data_not_big_data/links/5b8651bd92851c1e12390bb0/Smart-cities-need-thick-data-not-big-data.pdf?origin=publication_detail). 
* David Hunter’s [Data Walking](http://www.corruptedfiles.org.uk/portfolio/data-walking/) research project aims to collect environmental data while walking around North Greenwich, to build a rich picture of that area over time. Data gathering devices include sensors on micro controllers, smart phones, and recorded notes. This data is then used to create maps, charts, data experiences, or artistic works by participants to represent the area and the process of the project.
* Visit Trevor Hogan's site on [Tactile Data](http://tactiledata.net/) to see a variety of data physicalization ideas in action.
* "The sound of salmon can be used to understand their migration. The soundtrack to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhpHi8TOryY) is the detailed movement of 45 juvenile salmon from the Snake River as they make their way to the ocean. It is scientific data turned to sound. Can you hear the movement of the population downstream to the ocean?" 
* Students in Civic Art & Design Studio (IN123), with professor [Catherine DʼIgnazio](http://www.kanarinka.com/), visualized 100 of the more than 6,000 citizen questions collected by the City of Boston as part of the GoBoston 2030 transportation planning process. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Q70ppWVSk) is realized as a large, projected public art installation. Are you interested in making your own gifs? There are lots of great resources on the web. Check out the [repo on making data-related animated gifs](https://github.com/lenagroeger/gifs) from [Lena Groeger](https://twitter.com/lenagroeger) of ProPublica.
* Have you ever tried to imagine how a fish soup tastes whose recipe is based on publicly available local fishing data? Or what a pizza would be like if it was based on Helsinki’s population mix? [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net/), led by [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner), explores food as a means of data expression - or, if you like – edible diagrams.

## Power ##
* Read [Miriam Posner](https://twitter.com/miriamkp)'s summary of her keynote on [The radical potential of the Digital Humanities: The most challenging computing problem is the interrogation of power](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/08/12/the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/) to think more about structures of power, like race and gender, as they relate to how we use data.
* A pop-up shop in London will trade you your data for something you want to buy. Take a look [inside the store that only accepts personal data as currency](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/data-dollar-store-london-ben-eine/).
