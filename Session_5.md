In our final session, we will look at the larger roles and responsibilities educators have in using data.

## Agenda ##

## Projects and examples ##
* David Hunter’s [Data Walking](http://www.corruptedfiles.org.uk/portfolio/data-walking/) research project aims to collect environmental data while walking around North Greenwich, to build a rich picture of that area over time. Data gathering devices include sensors on micro controllers, smart phones, and recorded notes. This data is then used to create maps, charts, data experiences, or artistic works by participants to represent the area and the process of the project.
* Visit Trevor Hogan's site on [Tactile Data](http://tactiledata.net/) to see a variety of data physicalization ideas in action.
* "The sound of salmon can be used to understand their migration. The soundtrack to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhpHi8TOryY) is the detailed movement of 45 juvenile salmon from the Snake River as they make their way to the ocean. It is scientific data turned to sound. Can you hear the movement of the population downstream to the ocean?" You may also want to check out Willian Justen's repo of [Awesome Audio Visualizations](https://github.com/willianjusten/awesome-audio-visualization).
* Have you ever tried to imagine how a fish soup tastes whose recipe is based on publicly available local fishing data? Or what a pizza would be like if it was based on Helsinki’s population mix? [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net/), led by [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner), explores food as a means of data expression - or, if you like – edible diagrams.

## Power ##
* Read [Miriam Posner](https://twitter.com/miriamkp)'s summary of her keynote on [The radical potential of the Digital Humanities: The most challenging computing problem is the interrogation of power](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2015/08/12/the-radical-unrealized-potential-of-digital-humanities/) to think more about structures of power, like race and gender, as they relate to how we use data.
* A pop-up shop in London will trade you your data for something you want to buy. Take a look [inside the store that only accepts personal data as currency](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/07/data-dollar-store-london-ben-eine/).
