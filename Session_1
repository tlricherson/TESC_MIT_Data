In this session, we will consider how data use in schools has evolved, as well as an overview of the skills needed to use data effectively in the classroom. We will also start building an idea of what it means to tell a story with data.

* Learn more about the [history of data visualization in journalism](https://eagereyes.org/link/scott-klein-on-the-history-of-data-journalism) as told by [Scott Klein](https://twitter.com/kleinmatic) of ProPublica. You can watch his presentation at the 2016 Tapestry conference at the link above.
* Watch the 2016 Eyeo presentation, [Setting Tangents around a Circle](https://vimeo.com/channels/eyeo2016/176869833), from [Josh Begley](https://twitter.com/joshbegley) and consider the impact of our choices about which data to include or exclude.
* Have you ever tried to imagine how a fish soup tastes whose recipe is based on publicly available local fishing data? Or what a pizza would be like if it was based on Helsinki’s population mix? [Data Cuisine](http://data-cuisine.net/), led by [Moritz Stefaner](https://twitter.com/moritz_stefaner), explores food as a means of data expression - or, if you like – edible diagrams.
* Students in Civic Art & Design Studio (IN123), with professor [Catherine DʼIgnazio](http://www.kanarinka.com/), visualized 100 of the more than 6,000 citizen questions collected by the City of Boston as part of the GoBoston 2030 transportation planning process. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Q70ppWVSk) is realized as a large, projected public art installation. Are you interested in making your own gifs?
