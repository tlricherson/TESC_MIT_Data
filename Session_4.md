# Session 4: Transform information into a decision #

At some point, we have to move beyond *admiring the problem*. How do we do that? What does it look like? In this session, we'll consider the tools and strategies available to us as we diagnose, implement, monitor, and adjust our instruction. We'll consider traditional data walls in schools, as well as the role of student voice. What happens when students track and use their own data to identify goals and monitor progress?

This was your input on the elements of the framework that needed attention (a couple votes each for *diagnosing causes* and *understanding the context*):

(2017), [Teachers interpreting data for instructional decisions: where does equity come in?](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brette_Garner/publication/316533903_Teachers_Interpreting_Data_for_Instructional_Decisions_Where_Does_Equity_Come_In/links/59e676a54585151e545cdf24/Teachers-Interpreting-Data-for-Instructional-Decisions-Where-Does-Equity-Come-In.pdf), Journal of Educational Administration, Vol. 55 No. 4, pp. 407-426. https://doi.org/10.1108/JEA-09-2016-0106 

This is a super-dense article, but it is worth your time and effort to digest. As you read, think about the PLC-directed conversations you have had during your fall placement. Where did equity take a central role? Where was it just a supporting role?

## Agenda ##
* Looking vs. Seeing
* Getting from *So what?* to *Now what?*
> * Discussion of Garner, et al. article
> * Using diagnostic reports
* Student-involved data use (SIDU)

Some Twitter bots may provoke your thinking about the difference between *looking* and *seeing*. Follow the [picsdescbot](https://twitter.com/picdescbot) and [What do you see?](https://twitter.com/tinydotblot).

### Traditional data walls ###
[Data walls](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23datawall&src=typd) and [data binders](https://twitter.com/search?q=data%20binder&src=typd) are two of the most common types of semi-public data displays. There are entire [district cultures devoted to using these](http://qualitycommunityschools.weebly.com/data-walls.html), as well as a network of resources through the [sharing economy of blogs](http://www.thecurriculumcorner.com/thecurriculumcorner123/2014/07/student-data-binder/) and sources like Teacher Pay Teachers. 

Some classroom teachers take this a step further and have students track and use their own data. There are references to this in our instructional frameworks; however, student-involved data use is a relatively new area of educational research. A selection of articles is included in the literature review section of this page. 

Can a traditional data wall also be a data story? It's possible, but many do not take this path. What is the difference...and why should we care?
