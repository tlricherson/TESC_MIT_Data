## Readings ##
Garner, B., Thorne, J. and Horn, I. (2017), [Teachers interpreting data for instructional decisions: where does equity come in?](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brette_Garner/publication/316533903_Teachers_Interpreting_Data_for_Instructional_Decisions_Where_Does_Equity_Come_In/links/59e676a54585151e545cdf24/Teachers-Interpreting-Data-for-Instructional-Decisions-Where-Does-Equity-Come-In.pdf), Journal of Educational Administration, Vol. 55 No. 4, pp. 407-426. https://doi.org/10.1108/JEA-09-2016-0106 

This is a super-dense article, but it is worth your time and effort to digest. As you read, think about the conversations you have had during your fall placement that were PLC-directed. Where did equity take a central role? Where was it just a supporting role?
