Although we will have some practice with talking about data visualization throughout all of our sessions, this one will focus on some practical knowledge in terms of constructing these visuals.

## Tell me a story ##
We are rarely good storytellers...but why? An article from PsychCentral explores why [most people are awful storytellers](https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/02/15/why-most-people-are-awful-storytellers/116460.html) and The Book of Life provides some tips on [how to narrate your dreams](http://www.thebookoflife.org/how-to-narrate-your-dreams/). Even better, check out [The Art of Storytelling](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/storytelling), a free course from Pixar. It is part of their [Pixar in a Box](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar) program that helps you learn how their artists do their jobs.

Learn more about Kurt Vonnegut's [diagrams of stories](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/09/kurt-vonnegut-graphed-the-worlds-most-popular-stories/?utm_term=.7faeb0f90a4a).

Explore the [infernal topography](http://www.alpacaprojects.com/inferno/en/) based on Dante's Inferno. 

Some Twitter bots may provoke your thinking about the difference between *looking* and *seeing*. Follow the [picsdescbot](https://twitter.com/picdescbot) and [What do you see?](https://twitter.com/tinydotblot). Or, go old school and check out some [droodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droodles).

## Inspiration ##
Check out [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), "a year-long, analog data drawing project by [Giorgia Lupi](https://twitter.com/giorgialupi) and [Stefanie Posavec](https://twitter.com/stefpos), two award-winning information designers living on different sides of the Atlantic. By collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends."

Visit the Pinterest sites of [Jon Schwabish](https://www.pinterest.com/jonschwabish/) or [Lynn Cherny](https://www.pinterest.com/arnicas/) for tagged collections of charts (good, bad, and ugly), design items, and more.

[Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi) has an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/monachalabi/) feed of her hand drawn charts on a variety of topics. Also, have a look the work of [Catherine Madden](https://twitter.com/catmule) who integrates data, design, and drawing. Michelle Rial posts [real life charts](https://www.instagram.com/realifecharts/) over on Instagram and two students share their ideas over at [Our Paper Data](https://ourpaperdata.wordpress.com/). For a more local flavour, scan the [Seattle Walk Report](https://www.instagram.com/seattlewalkreport/).


## Tools and strategies ##
* There are any number of collections of data viz options. For chart ideas, take a look at the [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com), [The Chartmaker Directory](http://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/), or [The Data Visualization Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/). Google News Lab and Adioma have just released the [Visualization Universe](http://visualizationuniverse.com/), a comprehensive site for books, charts, and tools about all things visualization.
