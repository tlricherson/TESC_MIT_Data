Although we will have some practice with talking about data visualization throughout all of our sessions, this one will focus on some practical knowledge in terms of constructing these visuals.



# What are the *tools* and *strategies* for building a data wall? #

So, you're ready to build a data story. Now that you have your idea (and a wall or other space for the display), how do you get started? And what do you do if you get stuck?

## Tell me a story ##
We are rarely good storytellers...but why? An article from PsychCentral explores why [most people are awful storytellers](https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/02/15/why-most-people-are-awful-storytellers/116460.html) and The Book of Life provides some tips on [how to narrate your dreams](http://www.thebookoflife.org/how-to-narrate-your-dreams/). Even better, check out [The Art of Storytelling](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/storytelling), a free course from Pixar. It is part of their [Pixar in a Box](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar) program that helps you learn how their artists do their jobs.

Explore the [infernal topography](http://www.alpacaprojects.com/inferno/en/) based on Dante's Inferno. 

Some Twitter bots may provoke your thinking about the difference between *looking* and *seeing*. Follow the [picsdescbot](https://twitter.com/picdescbot) and [What do you see?](https://twitter.com/tinydotblot). Or, go old school and check out some [droodles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droodles).

## Inspiration ##
Check out [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), "a year-long, analog data drawing project by [Giorgia Lupi](https://twitter.com/giorgialupi) and [Stefanie Posavec](https://twitter.com/stefpos), two award-winning information designers living on different sides of the Atlantic. By collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends."

Visit the Pinterest sites of [Jon Schwabish](https://www.pinterest.com/jonschwabish/) or [Lynn Cherny](https://www.pinterest.com/arnicas/) for tagged collections of charts (good, bad, and ugly), design items, and more.

[Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi) has an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/monachalabi/) feed of her hand drawn charts on a variety of topics. Also, have a look the work of [Catherine Madden](https://twitter.com/catmule) who integrates data, design, and drawing. Michelle Rial posts [real life charts](https://www.instagram.com/realifecharts/) over on Instagram and two students share their ideas over at [Our Paper Data](https://ourpaperdata.wordpress.com/). For a more local flavour, scan the [Seattle Walk Report](https://www.instagram.com/seattlewalkreport/).

If you have 20 minutes, I highly recommend this TED talk by Elizabeth Gilbert on [your elusive creative genius](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius)...and if you don't have 20 minutes, [read the transcript](https://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius/transcript). This is a fabulous summary about *The Muse*. If you're a leader, you may also want to read about how to support better outcomes by [avoiding arbitrary deadlines](https://work.qz.com/1173131/deadlines-dont-have-to-kill-creativity-according-to-harvard-research/). 

## Tools and strategies ##
* There are any number of collections of data viz options. For chart ideas, take a look at the [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com), [The Chartmaker Directory](http://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/), or [The Data Visualization Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/). Google News Lab and Adioma have just released the [Visualization Universe](http://visualizationuniverse.com/), a comprehensive site for books, charts, and tools about all things visualization.

## Behind the scenes ##
Sometimes, as data designers, you have to [kill your darlings](http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/10/18/_kill_your_darlings_writing_advice_what_writer_really_said_to_murder_your.html), or as Dan Greenberg said, "Marry the problem, not the solution." However, there is much to be learned from sharing the process that leads to the final story. Here are a few examples:
* [Nicholas Rougeux](https://twitter.com/rougeux) has shared not only the process he used to create [visualizations of classical music](https://www.c82.net/blog/?id=72), but also many of the various iterations of ideas he had. 
* Eleanor Lutz gives a [tour of the rough drafts and sketches](http://tabletopwhale.com/2016/10/20/rough-drafts-and-sketches.html) behind her infographic on [heartbeats and heart attacks](http://tabletopwhale.com/2016/10/19/heartbeats-and-heart-attacks.html).

## Build more background knowledge ##
ProPublica has shared all of materials from their [Data Institute](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/announcing-free-videos-and-training-materials-from-the-propublica-data-institute). You can access slides, handouts, and videos of the work they do with journalists to present data on the web.

Over at the Wikimedia Foundation, Mikhail Popov "shared a workshop on how to interpret different types of statistical graphics and how to glean insights from them. The [workshop is now available on a website](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/02/21/data-visualization-literacy-workshop/) for everyone to learn from."

[Enrico Bertini](https://twitter.com/FILWD) posts all of his NYU [course materials on information visualization](http://enrico.bertini.io/teaching/), as does [Nick Sousanis](https://twitter.com/Nsousanis) for his classes on [comics as a way of thinking](http://spinweaveandcut.com/comics-as-thinking-15/).

While not related directly to our topic, you may be interested in reviewing [Gene Kogan](https://twitter.com/genekogan)'s resources on [machine learning for artists](https://ml4a.github.io/). You can access tutorials, lots of background text, and more to get you started on a journey in this area.
