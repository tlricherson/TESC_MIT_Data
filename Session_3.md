# Session 3: Transform data into information #

For our third session, we'll look at organizing and transforming data, as well as considering some ethical questions. How do we make decisions about what we include or exclude? This means we will dabble in both the *Use data* part of the framework and *Transform data into information*. Although we will have some practice with talking about data visualization throughout all of our sessions, this one will focus on some practical knowledge in terms of constructing these visuals.

Your self-evaluation and input on using data are on the page for session two. Here is what you shared about transforming data:

</p>

While there was not a strong consensus to set our direction here, there were two notes each for *Understand and use data displays and representations.* and *Consider the impact and consequences...* We could spend an entire course (and then some) on the first one, but we'll take some time to learn and apply some basic rules and tools for representing and reviewing data displays. Data ethics is also a broad (and important) topic. We'll start the conversation here, and continue on in Session Five.

We are rarely good storytellers...but why? An article from PsychCentral explores why [most people are awful storytellers](https://psychcentral.com/news/2017/02/15/why-most-people-are-awful-storytellers/116460.html) and The Book of Life provides some tips on [how to narrate your dreams](http://www.thebookoflife.org/how-to-narrate-your-dreams/). Even better, check out [The Art of Storytelling](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar/storytelling), a free course from Pixar. It is part of their [Pixar in a Box](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/pixar) program that helps you learn how their artists do their jobs.

Some Twitter bots may provoke your thinking about the difference between *looking* and *seeing*.

## Inspiration ##
Check out [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/theproject), "a year-long, analog data drawing project by [Giorgia Lupi](https://twitter.com/giorgialupi) and [Stefanie Posavec](https://twitter.com/stefpos), two award-winning information designers living on different sides of the Atlantic. By collecting and hand drawing their personal data and sending it to each other in the form of postcards, they became friends." If you have an hour, watch the Eyeo [presentation on the Dear Data Project](https://vimeo.com/133608605).

Visit the Pinterest sites of [Jon Schwabish](https://www.pinterest.com/jonschwabish/) or [Lynn Cherny](https://www.pinterest.com/arnicas/) for tagged collections of charts (good, bad, and ugly), design items, and more.

[Mona Chalabi](https://twitter.com/MonaChalabi) has an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/monachalabi/) feed of her hand drawn charts on a variety of topics. Also, have a look the work of [Catherine Madden](https://twitter.com/catmule) who integrates data, design, and drawing. Michelle Rial posts [real life charts](https://www.instagram.com/realifecharts/) over on Instagram and two students share their ideas over at [Our Paper Data](https://ourpaperdata.wordpress.com/).

## Tools and strategies ##
* There are any number of collections of data viz options. For chart ideas, take a look at the [Data Viz Project](http://datavizproject.com), [The Chartmaker Directory](http://chartmaker.visualisingdata.com/), or [The Data Visualization Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/). Google News Lab and Adioma have just released the [Visualization Universe](http://visualizationuniverse.com/), a comprehensive site for books, charts, and tools about all things visualization.

## Bunny trails ##
* Watch the 2016 Eyeo presentation, [Setting Tangents around a Circle](https://vimeo.com/channels/eyeo2016/176869833), from [Josh Begley](https://twitter.com/joshbegley) and consider the impact of our choices about which data to include or exclude.
* What do we do about missing data...and why is it missing in the first place? [Mimi Onuoha](https://twitter.com/thistimeitsmimi) has started a repo to [explore this topic](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). At the 2016 Tapestry Conference, [Eva Galanes-Rosenbaum](https://twitter.com/NotoriousEGR) shares that [the plural of anecdote is not "data"...except when it is](http://www.tapestryconference.com/blog/2016/plural-anecdote-not-data%E2%80%94except-when-it) as a way to show how we can mitigate the effects of missing data. You may also be interested in this recent post on [four methods to deal with missing data](https://blog.socialcops.com/academy/resources/4-methods-missing-data/). [Andrea Rossi](https://twitter.com/rossiarossi) teaches about methodologies for surveying hidden, marginal, or excluded populations. You can view a [sample syllabus](https://www.shareweb.ch/site/DDLGN/news/Site%20Assets/2Q%20-%20Andrea%20Rossi%20-2016%20%20Applied%20Research%20Methods%20with%20Hiddan%20and%20Marginal%20populations.pdf) for ideas and links to relevant research in this area.
* All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity
* It's always important to be aware of the biases we bring to our work. Use this infographic codex to view [all possible cognitive biases in one spot](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-single-cognitive-bias/).
