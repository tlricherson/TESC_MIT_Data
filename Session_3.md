For our third session, we'll look at organizing and transforming data, as well as considering some ethical questions. How do we make decisions about what we include or exclude? What are the issues related to privacy when it comes to data?

## Resources ##
* The [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) is a federal law that protects student privacy in terms of education records. It even applies to college students like you. As a classroom teacher, it is important to understand what you should or shouldn't share (and with whom). 
* OSPI also has a page devoted to [student privacy](https://www.k12.wa.us/data-reporting/protecting-student-privacy) for our state. In addition, it uses a [data governance](https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/workgroups-committees/currently-meeting-workgroups/k-12-data-governance) group to determine what types of data should be collected.

## Bunny trails ##
* Watch the 2016 Eyeo presentation, [Setting Tangents around a Circle](https://vimeo.com/channels/eyeo2016/176869833), from [Josh Begley](https://twitter.com/joshbegley) and consider the impact of our choices about which data to include or exclude.
* Browse the [projects from the Tactical Technology Collective](https://tacticaltech.org/projects/all). These focus on three themes: politics of data, digital security and privacy, and exposing and shaping issues. [The White Room](https://tacticaltech.org/WhiteRoom) is highly recommended. You can also watch Marek Tuszynski speak about the project in this [Eyeo 2016 presentation](https://vimeo.com/178236532).
* All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity
* What do we do about missing data...and why is it missing in the first place? [Mimi Onuoha](https://twitter.com/thistimeitsmimi) has started a repo to [explore this topic](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). At the 2016 Tapestry Conference, [Eva Galanes-Rosenbaum](https://twitter.com/NotoriousEGR) shares that [the plural of anecdote is not "data"...except when it is](http://www.tapestryconference.com/blog/2016/plural-anecdote-not-data%E2%80%94except-when-it) as a way to show how we can mitigate the effects of missing data. You may also be interested in this recent post on [four methods to deal with missing data](https://blog.socialcops.com/academy/resources/4-methods-missing-data/). [Andrea Rossi](https://twitter.com/rossiarossi) teaches about methodologies for surveying hidden, marginal, or excluded populations. You can view a [sample syllabus](https://www.shareweb.ch/site/DDLGN/news/Site%20Assets/2Q%20-%20Andrea%20Rossi%20-2016%20%20Applied%20Research%20Methods%20with%20Hiddan%20and%20Marginal%20populations.pdf) for ideas and links to relevant research in this area.
* It's always important to be aware of the biases we bring to our work. Use this infographic codex to view [all possible cognitive biases in one spot](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-single-cognitive-bias/).
