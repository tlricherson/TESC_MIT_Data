# Session 3: Transform data into information #

For our third session, we'll look at organizing and transforming data, as well as considering some ethical questions. How do we make decisions about what we include or exclude? This means we will dabble in both the *Use data* part of the framework and *Transform data into information*. Your self-evaluation and input on using data are on the page for session two. Here is what you shared about transforming data:

</p>

While there was not a strong consensus to set our direction here, there were two notes each for *Understand and use data displays and representations.* and *Consider the impact and consequences...* We could spend an entire course (and then some) on the first one, but we'll take some time to learn and apply some basic rules and tools for representing and reviewing data displays. Data ethics is also a broad (and important) topic. We'll start the conversation here, and continue on in Session Five.

* Watch the 2016 Eyeo presentation, [Setting Tangents around a Circle](https://vimeo.com/channels/eyeo2016/176869833), from [Josh Begley](https://twitter.com/joshbegley) and consider the impact of our choices about which data to include or exclude.
* What do we do about missing data...and why is it missing in the first place? [Mimi Onuoha](https://twitter.com/thistimeitsmimi) has started a repo to [explore this topic](https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets). At the 2016 Tapestry Conference, [Eva Galanes-Rosenbaum](https://twitter.com/NotoriousEGR) shares that [the plural of anecdote is not "data"...except when it is](http://www.tapestryconference.com/blog/2016/plural-anecdote-not-data%E2%80%94except-when-it) as a way to show how we can mitigate the effects of missing data. You may also be interested in this recent post on [four methods to deal with missing data](https://blog.socialcops.com/academy/resources/4-methods-missing-data/). [Andrea Rossi](https://twitter.com/rossiarossi) teaches about methodologies for surveying hidden, marginal, or excluded populations. You can view a [sample syllabus](https://www.shareweb.ch/site/DDLGN/news/Site%20Assets/2Q%20-%20Andrea%20Rossi%20-2016%20%20Applied%20Research%20Methods%20with%20Hiddan%20and%20Marginal%20populations.pdf) for ideas and links to relevant research in this area.
* All work with data---from the labels we choose to the charts we design---has potential inequitable impacts. Lena Groeger writes about some of these in [Forms Matter](https://source.opennews.org/articles/forms-matter/): how the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling & shape identity
* It's always important to be aware of the biases we bring to our work. Use this infographic codex to view [all possible cognitive biases in one spot](http://www.visualcapitalist.com/every-single-cognitive-bias/).
