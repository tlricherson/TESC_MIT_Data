During this session, we will consider how to use questions to drive inquiry into our classroom practices. We will also look at how data are collected and communicated between both users and systems.

While most of the work of a classroom teacher may not include frequent access with state or national data, it is important to understand how to access additional information.



## Resources ##
* The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) hosts a variety of data, from student performance, to facilities, to fiscal allocations, and more. We will talk about the various paths and connections between these during class time, but here are a few of the most relevant starting points to learn more:
** You can view and download historic data for districts and schools on the [Data Portal](https://www.k12.wa.us/data-reporting/data-portal).
** Our state [report card](https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/) is intended to answer parent and community questions about student demographics, program participation, and performance.
