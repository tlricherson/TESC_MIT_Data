# Session 2: Frame questions and use data #

During this session, we will consider how to use questions to drive inquiry into our classroom practices. We will also look at how data are collected and communicated between both users and systems and ethics related to that. While most of the work of a classroom teacher may not include frequent access with state or national data, it is important to understand how to access additional information. 

This page is rather long. :/  The top section relates to the *Identify problems and frame questions* section of our framework. Keep on scrolling down for *Use data*.

## Frame questions ##

Here is what your input on the framework looked like for **Identify problems and frame questions** and **Use data**. These are the two areas of the framework we will focus on during our time together.:

*Involve other participants or stakeholders* was identified by three students as something they most wanted to learn in this area. I've placed some resources at the bottom of this page, but we will certainly spend some time talking about how to include educators, parents, and students as part of the decision-making process. How do we involve other stakeholders in our work? Whether they are peers, students, families, or community, we can use data with them (as opposed to something we do to them) to enact and support positive change.

### Background ###
One of the promises of our abundance of data is its _democratization_—the ability for anyone to access and share the stories found within the data. However, this work requires a basic level of data literacy that many may not have. Miriam Posner, a professor in the digital humanities program at UCLA, reminds us that “The boxes we use to label others are often not the ones they might use to describe themselves.” When data use and storytelling with data are the province of only a few skilled people, we are not inclusive of the views of others. We can only expect disproportionate outcomes from this absence of voice “because a single visualization supplied by authorities may show only one facet of the data” (Jofre, 2016). To use data in service of equity, we must do better in our collaborations with students, parents, and the community. This is not just about building their skills with data, but also creating spaces for them to tell their own stories. In Feminism and Methodology: Social Science Issues (1987), Sandra Harding notes that “the questions an oppressed group wants answered are rarely requests for so-called truth. Instead, they are queries about how to change conditions.” 

### Resources ###
The sites below are offered as some quick starting points for exploration. You do not need to review them in depth, but take a quick glance at them. Consider where the data entered either about you or by you ends up. 

* The [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) is a federal law that protects student privacy in terms of education records. It even applies to college students like you. As a classroom teacher, it is important to understand what you should or shouldn't share (and with whom). 
* OSPI also has a page devoted to [student privacy](https://www.k12.wa.us/data-reporting/protecting-student-privacy) for our state. In addition, it uses a [data governance](https://www.k12.wa.us/about-ospi/workgroups-committees/currently-meeting-workgroups/k-12-data-governance) group to determine what types of data should be collected.

### Sample projects ###
* Check out a community-based example from Barcelona and consider the reasons wy [Smart Cities Need Thick Data, Not Big Data](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Adrian_Smith15/publication/326849902_Smart_cities_need_thick_data_not_big_data/links/5b8651bd92851c1e12390bb0/Smart-cities-need-thick-data-not-big-data.pdf?origin=publication_detail). 
* Students in Civic Art & Design Studio (IN123), with professor [Catherine DʼIgnazio](http://www.kanarinka.com/), visualized 100 of the more than 6,000 citizen questions collected by the City of Boston as part of the GoBoston 2030 transportation planning process. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Q70ppWVSk) is realized as a large, projected public art installation. Are you interested in making your own gifs? There are lots of great resources on the web. Check out the [repo on making data-related animated gifs](https://github.com/lenagroeger/gifs) from [Lena Groeger](https://twitter.com/lenagroeger) of ProPublica.
* Browse the [projects from the Tactical Technology Collective](https://tacticaltech.org/projects/all). These focus on three themes: politics of data, digital security and privacy, and exposing and shaping issues. [The White Room](https://tacticaltech.org/WhiteRoom) is highly recommended. You can also watch Marek Tuszynski speak about the project in this [Eyeo 2016 presentation](https://vimeo.com/178236532).


## Use data ##

</p>

There was not a clear cut winner in this area. We will try to address the various learning interests in Sessions 2 and 3. For this session, we will primarily focus on *possible sources/variety of data*. We will also start a conversation about data privacy and ethics around what we collect and share.

### Data sources ###
The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) hosts a variety of data, from student performance, to facilities, to fiscal allocations, and more. We will talk about the various paths and connections between these during class time, but here are a few of the most relevant starting points to learn more:
* You can view and download historic data for districts and schools on the [Data Portal](https://www.k12.wa.us/data-reporting/data-portal).
* Our state [report card](https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/) is intended to answer parent and community questions about student demographics, program participation, and performance.

The [Educational Research Data Center (ERDC)](http://www.erdc.wa.gov/) has built a longitudinal data system that includes information on Washington students across multiple sectors. These sectors include early learning, K-12, post-secondary, and workforce sectors. These data are shared with ERDC by partnering agencies and institutions across the state. In this way, ERDC acts as a kind of “central hub,” where partnering agencies, institutions, and organizations can pool their data and seek answers to questions that none of them have the resources to answer by themselves.

Visit the [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) is the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the U.S. and other nations. You may also be interested in the [Civil Rights Data Collection](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/) which collects and publishes educational data related to civil rights and equity.

Many public organizations have open data collections (and, if not, you can obtain information through the public disclosure process). Here are some [links to additional collections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0), including wikipedia edits, air quality, Pokemon, and more.

Head over to [Data USA](https://datausa.io/), a "comprehensive website and visualization engine of public US Government data" to find, map, compare, or download all manner of data related to living in the United States.
