During this session, we will consider how to use questions to drive inquiry into our classroom practices. We will also look at how data are collected and communicated between both users and systems.

While most of the work of a classroom teacher may not include frequent access with state or national data, it is important to understand how to access additional information.

## Resources ##
The sites below are offered as some quick starting points for exploration. They are for reference only. 

The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) hosts a variety of data, from student performance, to facilities, to fiscal allocations, and more. We will talk about the various paths and connections between these during class time, but here are a few of the most relevant starting points to learn more:
* You can view and download historic data for districts and schools on the [Data Portal](https://www.k12.wa.us/data-reporting/data-portal).
* Our state [report card](https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/) is intended to answer parent and community questions about student demographics, program participation, and performance.

The [Educational Research Data Center (ERDC)](http://www.erdc.wa.gov/) has built a longitudinal data system that includes information on Washington students across multiple sectors. These sectors include early learning, K-12, post-secondary, and workforce sectors. These data are shared with ERDC by partnering agencies and institutions across the state. In this way, ERDC acts as a kind of “central hub,” where partnering agencies, institutions, and organizations can pool their data and seek answers to questions that none of them have the resources to answer by themselves.

Visit the [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) is the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing data related to education in the U.S. and other nations. You may also be interested in the [Civil Rights Data Collection](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/) which collects and publishes educational data related to civil rights and equity.

Many public organizations have open data collections (and, if not, you can obtain information through the public disclosure process). Here are some [links to additional collections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0), including wikipedia edits, air quality, Pokemon, and more.

Head over to [Data USA](https://datausa.io/), a "comprehensive website and visualization engine of public US Government data" to find, map, compare, or download all manner of data related to living in the United States.
